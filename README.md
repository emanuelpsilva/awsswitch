# awsswitch
An **aws-vault** helper
***
## Synopsis
If you are using **[aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault)** to manage several accounts with different roles then you probably are tired of always write *aws-vault exec profile --*
This simple script avoid the direct use of *aws-vault* and allows you to simply run awscli commands like *aws s3 ls* instead.
